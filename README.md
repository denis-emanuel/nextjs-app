## Description

I use this repo to learn Next.js by my own using the [Next.js Tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) and the [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started).

Most of the code here will be used mainly as a proof of concept and as a reference for future projects.

As I add more stuff to the project, I will update this README with more information and I will also use a CHANGELOG.md file to keep track of the changes.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Nextjs Info

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

### Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
